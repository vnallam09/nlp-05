> Structured EVTL pipeline for reliable extraction and transformation of data from HTML web pages.

Web Mining and Applied NLP require reliable acquisition and
processing of structured and semi-structured text data.
This project implements a reproducible pipeline for
working with HTML data from web pages.

The pipeline follows an EVTL architecture:

- Extract HTML from a web page
- Validate structure and content before use
- Transform HTML into a structured representation
- Load results into a persistent, analyzable format

The emphasis is on correctness, inspectability, and repeatability:
every stage has explicit inputs, outputs, and logging,
and intermediate artifacts are preserved for verification.

## This Project

This project demonstrates how to work with
HTML data retrieved from web pages using a structured EVTL pipeline.

The workflow:

- Acquire HTML from an external web page
- Inspect and validate its structure
- Transform it into a tabular representation
- Persist results for downstream analysis

Each stage is implemented as a modular component with explicit inputs and outputs.

## Key Files

These files define the EVTL pipeline and the components you will update for your project.

- **src/nlp/pipeline_web_html.py** - Main pipeline orchestrator (no changes required)
- **src/nlp/config_case.py** - Configuration for page URL and paths (<mark>**copy and edit**</mark> for your project)
- **src/nlp/stage01_extract.py** - Extract stage: fetches HTML from a web page (no changes required)
- **src/nlp/stage02_validate_case.py** - Validate stage: inspects and verifies HTML structure (<mark>**copy and edit**</mark>)
- **src/nlp/stage03_transform_case.py** - Transform stage: converts HTML into structured data (<mark>**copy and edit**</mark>)
- **src/nlp/stage04_load.py** - Load stage: writes output to persistent storage (no changes required)
- **pyproject.toml** - Project metadata and dependencies (<mark>**update**</mark> authorship, links, and dependencies)
- **zensical.toml** - Documentation configuration (<mark>**update**</mark> authorship and links)

## First: Follow These Instructions

Follow the [step-by-step workflow guide](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/workflow-b-apply-example-project/) to complete:

1. Phase 1. **Start & Run**
2. Phase 2. **Change Authorship**
3. Phase 3. **Read & Understand**

## Challenges

Challenges are expected.
Sometimes instructions may not quite match your operating system.
When issues occur, share screenshots, error messages, and details about what you tried.
Working through issues is an important part of implementing professional projects.

## Success

After completing Phase 1. **Start & Run**, you'll have your own GitHub project,
running on your machine, and running the example will print out:

```shell
========================
Pipeline executed successfully!
========================
```

The following artifacts will be created:

- project.log - confirming successful run
- data/raw/case_raw.json - dump of the fetched JSON
- data/processed/case_processed.csv - final loaded result

## Command Reference

The commands below are used in the workflow guide above.
They are provided here for convenience.

Follow the guide for the **full instructions**.

### In a machine terminal (open in your `Repos` folder)

After you get a copy of this repo in your own GitHub account,
open a machine terminal in your `Repos` folder:

```shell
# Replace username with YOUR GitHub username.
git clone https://github.com/vnallam09/nlp-05/
cd nlp-05
code .
```

### In a VS Code terminal

```shell
uv self update
uv python pin 3.14
uv sync --extra dev --extra docs --upgrade

uvx pre-commit install
git add -A
uvx pre-commit run --all-files

# Later, we install spacy data model and
# en_core_web_sm = english, core, web, small
# It's big: spacy+data ~200+ MB w/ model installed
#           ~350–450 MB for .venv is normal for NLP
# uv run python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# First, run the module
# IMPORTANT: Close each figure after viewing so execution continues
uv run python -m nlp.pipeline_web_html

uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check . --fix
uv run zensical build

git add -A
git commit -m "update"
git push -u origin main
```

</details>

## Notes

- Use the **UP ARROW** and **DOWN ARROW** in the terminal to scroll through past commands.
- Use `CTRL+f` to find (and replace) text within a file.

## Enhancements

In production systems, validation is often automated using tools
such as **Great Expectations** or **Soda**.

Within the EVTL architecture, **VALIDATE** is a key stage
with a clear source, process, and sink:

- **Source**: HTML fetched from the web page
- **Process**: parsing with BeautifulSoup, checking structure, confirming expected elements are present
- **Sink**: BeautifulSoup object passed to the TRANSFORM stage

This stage ensures the data is in a **consistent and reliable form**
before transformation begins,
so later steps can run without errors or unexpected results.

In this project, validation is implemented directly,
so all checks are visible, repeatable, and easy to review as part
of the pipeline.
